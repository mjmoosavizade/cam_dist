## Introduction

  

This code implements an image undistortion function using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. Distorted images often arise due to lens imperfections in cameras, resulting in distortions such as barrel, pincushion, or mustache effects. This code aims to rectify such distortions, potentially improving the quality and usefulness of images for various applications.

  

## Function Description

  

The undistort_image function takes three arguments:

  

 - **image_path**: (string) The path to the image file to be undistorted.
 - **camera_matrix**: (NumPy array) A 3x3 camera matrix that captures
   intrinsic camera parameters, typically obtained through camera
   calibration.
 - **distortion_coeffs**: (NumPy array) A vector of distortion coefficients
   describing the type and magnitude of distortion present in the image. [k1, k2, p1, p2, k3]

**Output**

  

The function returns a NumPy array representing the undistorted image or None if an error occurs.

## Example

**Usage**

  
 

    image_path = "frame223.png" # Replace with your image path
    
    camera_matrix = np.array([ # Replace with your camera matrix
    
	    [2152.8, 0, 971.3],    
	    [0, 2155.5, 605.9],
	    [0, 0, 1],
    ])
    
    distortion_coeffs = np.array([ # Replace with your distortion coefficients
	    0.32140973983357052, 0.03911369921165378, 0.0046883190539842362, 0.71061685361298299, 0
    ])

  
## Dependencies

  

This code requires the OpenCV library to be installed. You can install it using `pip install -t requirements.txt` in your terminal.


## How to Use

  

**Replace placeholders:**

 - Update image_path with the path to your image file.
 - Replace camera_matrix and distortion_coeffs with the actual values   
   obtained from camera calibration for your specific camera setup.   
   
 Refer to OpenCV documentation or online resources for camera calibration procedures.

**Run the script:**

    python main.py
